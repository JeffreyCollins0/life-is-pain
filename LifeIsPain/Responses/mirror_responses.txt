[STARTER/GUD/01]
I'll need to cheer up before I can test my material out there...

[_TIDBITS/03_]
How long has it been since I left and talked to anyone?
I know my way around a good pun, at least. That's gotta count for something.
Did I remember to pet my plushie for luck?

[BASE/BAD/01]
No, that topic-joke pair doesn't make sense... I really have lost my touch.
[BASE/GUD/01]
Yes. That's just a good joke, no ifs, ands or buts.

[MODIFIER/BAD/01]
Ugh, that one would've been good, but the embellishment killed it.
[MODIFIER/GUD/01]
Yeah, that last modifier really sells it. I'll remember that.

[OVERUSE/BAD/01]
I can't keep making the same joke too many times, it'd get old.

[UNLOCK/050]
These shades were a gift from a friend of mine. So thoughtful...

[UNLOCK/100]
Sometimes you gotta tell it like it is. Sugarcoating won't help.
