[STARTER/GUD/01]
What do you want? I'm trying to live here.

[_TIDBITS/03_]
I love making art, even if I usually can't manage it. A lot of it ends up being protest graffiti, though.
I hate this place. The world's dying and nobody bothered to save it, and now I'm having to live with that.
Sometimes I wonder if I should talk to that gardener over there. Maybe they could help me out or something.

[GIFTS/BAD/01]
Nobody's forcing you to give gifts, alright? Some people like those, so back off.
[GIFTS/MID/01]
Come on, don't halfheart things like that.
[GIFTS/GUD/02]
People don't understand how much a gift means to people. That is, unless you halfheart it.
I got an amazing gift once. Changed my whole outlook on peopl- well, person. The rest are still terrible.

[PLANTS/BAD/01]
Yeah, I know I'm a plant, buddy. Whaddya want from me?
[PLANTS/MID/01]
Can you not state the obvious for five seconds?
[PLANTS/GUD/02]
Huh, someone who doesn't mock plants. Maybe there's hope for you lot after all.

[SUNGLASSES/GUD/01]
Sunglasses look so cool. Wish I had a pair, though it's not worth much when I don't have eyes.
[FRIENDS/GUD/01]
I've never had friends, but it sounds so fun. I guess tellin' people to get bent all the time doesn't help with that.
[SATIRIZE/GUD/01]
That's amazing. Never thought I'd be able to talk about how terrible things are without seein' red.
[HARD TRUTH/GUD/01]
Good to see someone else sees how messed up the world is. You don't let it get to you that much, though. Makes me think I should work on making my own life better.
[BOXES/GUD/01]
Boxes don't get enough credit. The nutrients in this dumpster've kept me alive for a long time. Not like I can smell anyway.

[MINIMIZE/BAD/01]
Oh yeah, jump on that bandwagon. Everyone still thinks I'm "just some plant" even though I've had to augment my body just to not wilt and die.
[EUPHEMISM/BAD/01]
Come off it with this halfhearted stuff. Euphemisms are what let people gloss over real problems just because it's "uncomfortable".
[WEATHER/BAD/02]
Yeah, the weather's terrible now that the climate's shifted. It's almost like people should have stood up and done something about that.
I can barely survive in this weather. Not like anyone with the power to change things cared what would happen to us plants... jerks.


[BASE/BAD/01]
That combo was a bad idea on a basic level.
[BASE/GUD/01]
Heh, that's a good one, plain and simple. 

[MODIFIER/BAD/01]
That would've been better, but the embellishment killed it.
[MODIFIER/GUD/01]
Nice one, that last bit of embellishment REALLY sold it.

[OVERUSE/BAD/01]
Come on, this topic again? Stop wastin' my time!

[UNLOCK/050]
A stranger gave me my first paints a while ago. That's the first nice thing anyone's done for me, and it kills me I never got their name.

[UNLOCK/100]
Make 'em think you'll do one thing, then do the opposite. They never see it coming. I think I'll work on turning my situation around, when I can manage it. Thanks, stranger.
