[STARTER/GUD/01]
Your eyes have no pupils, fascinating.

[_TIDBITS/03_]
I desire... pickles. This industrial runoff is at least moderately acidic, so it should work.
I've been refining the chemicals from this output to fortify and fertilize my garden. Plants don't survive naturally anymore, so I have to help them along.
I really hope someday I can make this a real garden, so people will understand the beauty of plants. This'll also help with the food supply, too, since it helps plants grow in harsh environments.

[HATS/BAD/01]
Oh good, not another "but I can't see your face" person. I need this for my research.
[HATS/MID/01]
If you're trying to mock my mask, it didn't work.
[HATS/GUD/03]
Nice of you to notice my mask. I love it, plus it means I don't have to worry about my facial expressions being weird.

[PLANTS/BAD/01]
Messed up a joke about plants. I'm disappointed, and that doesn't happen often. Well, back to drinking more chemicals.
[PLANTS/MID/01]
You could do better. Plants need a lot of cheering up with so little sunlight around.
[PLANTS/GUD/01]
You like plants too? Plants are amazing. They need a bit of modifying with the changes in climate and such, but they're so complicated and interesting.

[PLUSHIES/BAD/01]
Never really got plushies. They always get dirty from work, and then they just look so sad. It's a waste.

[TALK FUNNY/GUD/01]
You talk weird. I think we'll be best friends.
[EUPHEMISM/GUD/01]
Euphemisms are fun, and it's more fun to hear a new one and then loudly say what it means. People get angry when you do it, though. Odd.
[SATIRIZE/GUD/01]
Everything is crazy when you think hard enough. How does a plant coordinate every cell to do things? Good to see somebody else gets it.
[MINIMIZE/GUD/01]
A classic, take a big thing and make it sound like a small thing. Tale as old as time.
[WEATHER/GUD/01]
The weather's always grey around here, but it gives enough sunlight for the plants to grow, so it's fine.
[SUNGLASSES/GUD/01]
Oh, so you don't like eye contact either. I get ya, that's always weird.

[SHARP TURN/BAD/01]
What? You said a thing and then another thing that wasn't related. I'm confused.
[HARD TRUTH/BAD/01]
Yeah, I know the truth is hard. I sometimes wonder if the plants will all die when I do, and that makes me really sad.
[TIME/BAD/01]
Ugh, time is so slow! How am I supposed to experiment and iterate when the plants take so long to grow? Why can't it go faster?


[BASE/BAD/01]
That combo doesn't seem to work well. Try another.
[BASE/GUD/01]
That's a good combo. I wonder if it works with any topic... I could solve humor overnight.

[MODIFIER/BAD/01]
The base was good, but the additions didn't work. Just like runoff water...
[MODIFIER/GUD/01]
Good thing you added the extra modifier. I was trying not to laugh, but you got me anyway.

[OVERUSE/BAD/01]
You really like using that one topic. That goes against all my data on conversation.

[UNLOCK/050]
Plants are intriguing. I've spent most of my life growing plants, and I've had to improve my chemistry to help them along.

[UNLOCK/100]
I've been told my voice is weird. Maybe my mask filters it oddly, what with all the toxin filters I installed.
