[STARTER/GUD/01]
Hi... did you... need something?

[_TIDBITS/03_]
Do you... like comic books? I love them. They're great for getting away from it all...
I love this store. Sure, nobody else comes here, but it has these fluffy pillows to read all my favorite comics on.
Sorry for always... trailing off... I'm kind of self-conscious. About... everything.

[HATS/BAD/01]
Oh. I'm sorry... I know hats don't work on me...
[HATS/MID/01]
Hmm... Not a fan of hats, then.
[HATS/GUD/03]
Thanks... I like this hat.

[SUNGLASSES/BAD/01]
I guess? People in sunglasses scare me...
[SUNGLASSES/MID/01]
That was okay. I guess noir isn't really my thing...
[SUNGLASSES/GUD/01]
Normally I'm not a fan, but that made me feel a bit better.

[PLUSHIES/BAD/01]
Oh... I like plushies, but alright...
[PLUSHIES/MID/01]
That one was alright...
[PLUSHIES/GUD/01]
Haha, I LOVE plushies! They squish and don't have corners!

[WORDPLAY/GUD/01]
That's a good play on words. The mark of a good writer...
[TALK FUNNY/GUD/01]
*Wheeze* That sounds like my little brother! That's hilarious.
[EUPHEMISM/GUD/01]
Ha, I didn't know THAT was a euphemism for office work.
[DUAL-SPEAK/GUD/01]
Ooh, clever... Those are always hard to pull off, so... props.

[MINIMIZE/BAD/01]
That one hurt a bit... People look down on me 'cause I'm a cube...
[SLAPSTICK/BAD/01]
Wait, are you hurt!? What do I do? Amputation? Bandages? CPR?
[BOXES/GUD/01]
Haha! See, you get it. Cubes all the way.
[WEATHER/GUD/01]
I love weather like this. It's perfect for reading comic books...

[BASE/BAD/01]
That one... might not be the best idea, just, in general...
[BASE/GUD/01]
That's a good one. Simple jokes can work wonders sometimes...

[MODIFIER/BAD/01]
Did you... really need to add that last bit?
[MODIFIER/GUD/01]
Yeah, that extra spin on it really sold the joke.

[OVERUSE/BAD/01]
Oh, is this all the same kind of joke? I'm a little bored now...

[UNLOCK/050]
...Do you like plushies, too? I love how comforting they are...

[UNLOCK/100]
I know I should be more straightforward, but... It's so hard...
