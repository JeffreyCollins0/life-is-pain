[STARTER/GUD/01]
Heya, slick. How's it goin'?

[_TIDBITS/02_]
Don't mind the wind. This is my favorite place to stand and people-watch.
I tried taking the shades off once, but everything got too bright all of a sudden. Weird.

[HATS/BAD/01]
Hey, don't go bashing this hat of mine. It's a classic.
[HATS/MID/01]
Hmm... Not a fan of hats, then.
[HATS/GUD/03]
Good eye. This hat's my favorite!
I see you've got taste. I like that!
Heh, the hat really makes the person, doesn't it?

[SUNGLASSES/BAD/02]
So what if I wear shades? These were a gift from a friend.
Is it the shades, or was the punchline THAT hard to see?
[SUNGLASSES/MID/01]
Not great, not terrible either. It's gotta be hard, comin' up with jokes about shades.
[SUNGLASSES/GUD/02]
Nice one. I like the cut of your jib, pal.
Always nice to see someone who ain't afraid of shades.

[GIFTS/GUD/01]
HA! Didn't think I'd like joking about those, but that made me feel a lot better. Thanks, pal.
[BAD PUN/GUD/01]
There's an honesty in a good pun. I respect that.
[DEAD PAN/GUD/01]
Heh, almost didn't catch that one. When it works, the no-sell REALLY works.
[SLAPSTICK/GUD/01]
Going all in like that takes guts, pal. I really appreciate that.
[HARD TRUTH/GUD/01]
Yeah, call 'em like you see 'em! Really cuts to the heart of things.

[WORDPLAY/BAD/01]
Was that a play on words? I can't make sense of that stuff...
[DUAL-SPEAK/BAD/01]
I didn't catch that one. Just say what you mean.
[BOXES/BAD/01]
Boxes? Pull out all the creative stops, why don't you. Ugh...
[WEATHER/BAD/01]
Yeah, the weather sucks. We all KNOW it sucks. Don't gotta point it out.

[BASE/BAD/01]
Hate to say it, but that one wasn't good on a basic level.
[BASE/GUD/01]
Didn't even need the bells and whistles. That's just a good joke.

[MODIFIER/BAD/01]
That would've been better, but the embellishment killed it.
[MODIFIER/GUD/01]
Nice one, that last bit of embellishment REALLY sold it.

[OVERUSE/BAD/01]
Oh yeah, just keep using the same topic over and over. Great.

[UNLOCK/050]
These shades were a gift from a friend of mine. So thoughtful...

[UNLOCK/100]
Sometimes you gotta tell it like it is. Sugarcoating won't help.
