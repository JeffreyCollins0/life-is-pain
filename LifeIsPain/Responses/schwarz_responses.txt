[STARTER/GUD/01]
Terribly sorry, we're- well, I'M a bit swamped at the moment. This is the observatory. Kindly get out of the way.

[_TIDBITS/04_]
I would say you came at a terrible time, but there are no non-terrible times.
Apologies for the mess, I've been so overworked I haven't had the chance to clean.
At this point I don't even have meals. I just stress-eat constantly.
I used to have co-workers to help. Now it's just me and the satellite data.

[SLAPSTICK/GUD/01]
Slapstick brings me so much joy. You really are one of a kind, aren't you?
[SHARP TURN/GUD/02]
Good use of misdirection. It's the only kind of deception that's fun...
Well done. Here's a sharp turn for you: they took a working observatory with employees and equipment, and slashed the budget until only one was left.
[TALK FUNNY/GUD/01]
That one's great! It may not be that clever, but I'm just punchy enough from the sleep deprivation not to care. Well done.

[BAD PUN/BAD/01]
You've got better in you. If you have time for this, then don't settle for "good enough".
[EUPHEMISM/BAD/01]
I've no time to untangle implications. Are you here to tell jokes or not?

[BOXES/BAD/02]
Ah, boxes. These boxes with screens torment me day and night with data and analysis from a space satellite.
Who even bought that many screens to use for data readouts? Half of those I don't even use, they just stress me out.
[TIME/GUD/02]
Time? I'm short on that, though with my satellite's comms delay, I'm often left doing more work than I'm asked just to fill the time... I ought to stop doing that.
I wish I had some time off... I could probably just get my required tasks done and take some time while waiting for the next downlink.
[SPACE/GUD/02]
Oh, I love space more than anything. It's such a vibrant place, treacherous though it is. I suppose that's part of the thrill of it.
I love it! Space was what drew me to this job... and what enables my rampant workaholism. I really ought to stop running more experiments than needed.
[WEATHER/GUD/02]
A joke about the weather? That's a rare treat. I never go outside because of work, so I wouldn't know what the forecast is like for today.
Ah, the weather - always bringing clouds and signal interference. On the upside, it gives me time to catch up on my work, and for that I am grateful.

[BASE/BAD/01]
That combination needs rethinking. Consider it more carefully, preferably without interrupting my work.
[BASE/GUD/01]
A solid combination with solid execution. Well done.

[MODIFIER/BAD/01]
That embellishment was both unnecessary and detrimental. There's strength in simplicity.
[MODIFIER/GUD/01]
Good judgement, adding a modifier. It completed the package.

[OVERUSE/BAD/01]
Did you come here to tell jokes on only one topic? DO NOT waste my time.

[UNLOCK/050]
I could talk for hours about space. It's why I took this job... and why I haven't quit, even though I definitely should. *Sigh* the things we do for what we love...

[UNLOCK/100]
Slapstick might not seem clever, but its value is very real. It's an excellent source of catharsis, no?
