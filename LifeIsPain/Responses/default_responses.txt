[MISC/BAD/01]
Just... No.
[MISC/MID/01]
Eh, it was alright.
[MISC/GUD/01]
That's a good one!


[HATS/BAD/02]
Yeah... I can't pull off hats.
Wow, okay. I like hats.
[HATS/MID/02]
Hats ARE kind of weird. How and when did we decide to start wearing them?
Well, they keep the rain off. Like we need more rain...
[HATS/GUD/01]
Hats are always funny.


[BOXES/BAD/01]
Everything here looks like a box, doesn't it. A dim, grey box.
[BOXES/MID/01]
...Boxes? What about them?
[BOXES/GUD/01]
I love it! "Welcome to the future, live inside a world of cardboard!"


[WEATHER/BAD/01]
Ugh... The weather here is always terrible...
[WEATHER/MID/01]
Yep, the weather is the weather.
[WEATHER/GUD/01]
Ha! How long did you brainSTORM that one?


[SUNGLASSES/BAD/01]
You see those a lot these days, as if what little light remains is too bright.
[SUNGLASSES/MID/01]
Right, sunglasses. Because we see the sun so often...
[SUNGLASSES/GUD/01]
Can't go wrong with sunglasses!


[GIFTS/BAD/01]
...Remind me to never get you anything.
[GIFTS/MID/01]
I mean, I like giving gifts...
[GIFTS/GUD/01]
That joke was the real gift here.


[PLUSHIES/BAD/01]
C'mon, things are bad enough. Don't go bashing plushies...
[PLUSHIES/MID/01]
Plushies are alright... I guess.
[PLUSHIES/GUD/01]
Nice one! We all need some cuteness in life, right?


[SPACE/BAD/01]
Space, huh. Like it's even worth the effort in a world like this...
[SPACE/MID/01]
Space is cool. I don't know much about it, though.
[SPACE/GUD/01]
Space is awesome! It seems so much cooler than being here...


[PLANTS/BAD/01]
Now I'm reminded of how many houseplants I've killed...
[PLANTS/MID/01]
Plants are... something, I guess?
[PLANTS/GUD/01]
Plants definitely have a beauty to them, and not just the flowers.


[COMICS/BAD/01]
I never really got the whole "comic book" thing. Wouldn't a movie be better?
[COMICS/MID/01]
Comics? I don't really know enough to have an opinion...
[COMICS/GUD/01]
I used to read those as a kid! Those were really fun. I wonder if I should get back into it...


[FRIENDS/BAD/01]
I had some friends, though they're all gone now. There never seems to be the time these days...
[FRIENDS/MID/01]
I wonder where all my friends are now... I should check up on that.
[FRIENDS/GUD/01]
I might not have many, but my friends are great! I love them.


[TIME/BAD/01]
Yeah, the clock keeps ticking. It's the only thing more oppressive than this atmosphere.
[TIME/MID/01]
Time goes on. It is what it is, I guess...
[TIME/GUD/01]
It's weird how relative time is. These jokes are making the time pass fast, so you're clearly doing something right!


[OVERUSE/BAD/02]
This conversation is getting stale...
How many jokes are you going to make about that?
