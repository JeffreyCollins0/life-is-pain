Just... No.
[MISC/MID/01]
Eh, it was alright.
[MISC/GUD/01]
That's a good one!


[HATS/BAD/02]
Yeah... I can't pull off hats.
Wow, okay. I like hats.
[HATS/MID/02]
Hats ARE kind of weird. How and when did we decide to start wearing them?
Well, they keep the rain off. Like we need more rain...
[HATS/GUD/01]
Hats are always funny.


[BOXES/BAD/01]
Everything here looks like a box, doesn't it. A dim, grey box.
[BOXES/MID/01]
...Boxes? What about them?
[BOXES/GUD/01]
I love it! "Welcome to the future, live inside a world of cardboard!"


[WEATHER/BAD/01]
Ugh... The weather here is always terrible...
[WEATHER/MID/01]
Yep, the weather is the weather.
[WEATHER/GUD/01]
Ha! How long did you brainSTORM that one?


[SUNGLASSES/BAD/01]
You see those a lot these days, as if what little light remains is too bright.
[SUNGLASSES/MID/01]
Right, sunglasses. Because we see the sun so often...
[SUNGLASSES/GUD/01]
Can't go wrong with sunglasses!


[GIFTS/BAD/01]
...Remind me to never get you anything.
[GIFTS/MID/01]
I mean, I like giving gifts...
[GIFTS/GUD/01]
That joke was the real gift here.


[PLUSHIES/BAD/01]
C'mon, things are bad enough. Don't go bashing plushies...
[PLUSHIES/MID/01]
Plushies are alright... I guess.
[PLUSHIES/GUD/01]
Nice one! We all need some cuteness in life, right?

[OVERUSE/BAD/01]
This conversation is getting stale...
