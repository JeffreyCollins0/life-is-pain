- Types of cards -
Hello! This is a deckbuilder about telling jokes, and as such there are two types of cards.
Blue strategy cards are the core of your joke, while green modifier cards are extra effects that either apply immediately or when the next strategy card is played.

- Telling jokes -
To tell a joke, simply enter a conversation with someone, select a topic from the list in the top left and select a strategy card from your hand at the bottom.
Certain characters like and dislike certain strategies or topics, and certain topic-strategy pairs are innately more or less effective.

- Jokes, mood and stress -
The colored icons on strategy cards indicate whether a strategy is more or less likely to work.
When a joke succeeds, it will increase the other character's mood while slightly decreasing your stress level, and vice versa for when a joke fails.
Reaching 100 stress ends the conversation immediately, and getting a character's mood to 50% and 100% unlocks a topic and card exclusive to them.
