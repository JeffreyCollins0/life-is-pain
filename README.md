# Life Is Pain, and That's Hilarious
A comedic deck-builder video game about telling jokes to make the world less depressing.

Build a deck of comedic strategies and tailor your jokes to a varied cast of strange, colorful characters. Tell jokes to learn more about them and improve their mood while managing your own stress level in the process. The world is dying, but that doesn't mean you should just give up!
